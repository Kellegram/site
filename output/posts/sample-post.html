<p>This is my first post. I am a programmer who's interested in the
theoretical basis and how that could improve programming in practice.
One of my favourite programming languages is Haskell.</p>
<p>The name of this website is called "denotation" for a reason. It's
mainly got to do with denotational semantics, which to my understanding
is linking a snippet of code to it's canonical mathematical abstraction,
which I absolutely love. Writing code in hopes of keeping it as
denotational as possible allows us to reuse more code and for details to
be clearer.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-this-website-hosted">How is this website hosted?</h2>
<p>I use Cloudflare Pages for hosting and the beautiful domain name, and
I use Haskell and Slick to generate it. I would say something like "It
seems to be going well so far", but I'm writing this post without ever
trying to run it. In fact, I am writing this post <em>to</em> run it.
Wish me luck!</p>
